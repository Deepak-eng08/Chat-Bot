//CHAT-BOT APPLICATION

This project is a chatBot web application developed using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
The main objective of the project is to create an interactive chatbot system that allows users to communicate through a web interface.
The chatbot processes user queries and provides automated responses, showing how conversational applications can be built using full-stack web technologies. 
The frontend, developed with React.js, provides a user-friendly interface for chatting, while the backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, handles message routing, chatbot logic, and database operations.
MongoDB is used to store and manage user messages and responses.

The project demonstrates integration between client and server components using RESTful APIs, with a focus on clean architecture, modular design, and efficient state management.
The system supports real-time interaction and robust error handling, and it serves as a practical example of building full-stack web applications with dynamic user interaction.

// to run on your system

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install dependencies for both the backend and frontend using npm install, then start both servers.
The backend connects to a MongoDB database via a connection string stored in an .env file. 
The project is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and deployment.
